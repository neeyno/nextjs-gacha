## Description
This repository contains the front-end of the NFT game app.\
The NFT game is built on erc1155, Chainlink VRF, and "gacha"-mechanics. It features many collectible NFT items that can be obtained only through a gacha by making "pulls". To make a pull, the player has to spend some in-game tokens to get a random NFT. These NFTs are only available for a limited time and have tiers of rarity based on chance, with some appearing less frequently than others.

## Requirements
```bash
git --version
node --version
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
